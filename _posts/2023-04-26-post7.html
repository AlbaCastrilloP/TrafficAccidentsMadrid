<p>Imagine driving on a busy street in Madrid, minding your own business, when suddenly, out of nowhere, a car crashes into you. You're lucky to have escaped with just a few bruises
  and scratches, but the same can't be said for the driver of the other car. You can't help but wonder - what led to this accident, and could it have been prevented?</p>

<p>That's exactly what we set out to investigate - the drivers involved in traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023. We analysed the data and came up with some surprising insights 
  that shed light on the causes and trends behind these accidents. So, buckle up, and let's take a ride through our findings.</p>

<p>Our story starts with a surprising fact - the majority of accidents in Madrid involve male drivers between the ages of 40 and 44. Our first visualization shows the number of drivers by
  age and gender, and it's clear that this group has the highest number of accidents compared to other age and gender groups.</p>

<p>So, why is this age group at higher risk of accidents? We dug deeper into the data and found that most accidents involving this at-risk group occur during the afternoon rush hour, between
  11 am 3 pm. Our second visualization shows the accidents by hour of the day for this age and gender group. This could be due to increased traffic, fatigue from work, or distractions while driving.</p>

</figure>

<p>But the time of day is not the only factor contributing to accidents. Our third visualization shows the accidents by day of the week for this age and gender group, and it's clear that accidents 
  happen more frequently on Fridays and Saturdays. It's possible that the higher number of people out and about during the weekend, increased alcohol consumption, or an overall relaxation of driving
  safety habits could be contributing factors.</p>

<p>GRAPH?</p>

<p>Now, let's take a look at the types of vehicles involved in accidents. Our fourth visualization shows the accidents by type of vehicle, and it's clear that cars are the most common type of vehicle
  involved in accidents, followed by motorcycles and bicycles. However, heavy vehicles such as buses and trucks have a lower number of accidents. This could be due to their higher level of training
  and stricter safety regulations.</p>

</figure> 

<p>Lastly, let's talk about the victims involved in accidents. Our fifth visualization shows the accidents by type of victim, and it's clear that drivers are the most common type of victim, with 
  the strongest shade of purple, followed by passengers, darkest blue and pedestrians, lightest blue. This highlights the importance of drivers being responsible and alert on the road, as their 
  actions can have serious consequences not only for themselves but for others as well.</p>

<p>So, what can we take away from this story? Well, it's clear that there are specific groups of drivers who are at higher risk of accidents. By understanding these patterns, we can take steps
  to prevent accidents and promote safer driving habits on the road. This could include increased awareness campaigns targeting specific age and gender groups, or more targeted enforcement of traffic
  laws during peak hours or on certain days of the week.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our story about drivers involved in traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023 is a reminder of the importance of safe driving habits and the need for ongoing efforts to 
  promote safer roads.</p>

description: Imagine this - you're a passionate cyclist who loves to ride your bike around the beautiful city of Madrid. But you've always been a little nervous about the traffic, especially after hearing stories of accidents involving cyclists. You've always wondered - how common are these accidents? What are the causes? And how can they be prevented?

  Welcome to our in-depth analysis and visualization of traffic accidents in Madrid by bike, covering the four-year period from 2019 to 2023. As avid cyclists and advocates for road safety, we were inspired to take a closer look at this important issue and explore the data in order to better understand the patterns and trends of bicycle accidents in the city.
  
  Our analysis begins with a comprehensive examination of the data, which provides detailed information on the date and time of each accident, the location, the type of accident, and the severity of injuries sustained by the cyclist. As we start to visualize the data through graphs, charts, and maps, we begin to see patterns and trends emerging.

  One of the most striking observations is the sheer number of accidents that occur each year and day, indicating that this is an issue that requires urgent attention. We also observe that certain areas of the city have a higher concentration of accidents than others, and that these areas tend to be ones with high traffic volumes or complex intersections as for example Madridâ€™s centre is an area that cover most traffic accidents.

  In this map, it can be observed in a street view the zones & streets where most accidents occur.

  HERE WE ADD THE HEATMAP THAT SHOWS A STREET-VIEW OF THE BICYCLE ACCIDENTS.

  For instance, we observe that increasing the number of dedicated bike lanes and improving road signage and markings could go a long way in reducing the number of accidents, in streets like Avenida de Nazaret with Doctor Esquerdo Street most accidents are collected in the zone of Retiro/Madrid centre. We also note that there are certain times of day and areas of the city that are particularly dangerous for cyclists, and that targeted safety campaigns and education programs could help raise awareness among drivers and cyclists alike.

  Upon a careful analysis, we can observe a clear pattern emerging in the ranking of the areas posing the greatest threat to cyclists. Topping the list is Madrid's bustling city centre, which witnesses the highest volume of daily activity, ranging from vibrant streets and recreational areas to bustling office districts. Following closely behind is the Moncloa-Aravaca area, which is no surprise given its status as a bustling university hub, frequented by droves of young people on a daily basis. Bringing up the rear is the esteemed Salamanca neighbourhood, adjacent to the city centre, where countless businesses, eateries, and entertainment venues are found, alongside the stunning Retiro Park. Given its proximity to this popular destination, it's no wonder that Salamanca has become a veritable hotspot for cycling accidents. Indeed, it's a common sight to see locals pedalling through its streets en route to enjoy a leisurely day in the park. Our analysis of this important issue is not only informative, but also empowering. As cyclists and advocates for road safety, we believe that knowledge is power, and that by understanding the challenges facing cyclists on Madrid's roads, we can work towards creating a safer and more accessible environment for all.

  In conclusion, our analysis and visualization of traffic accidents in Madrid by bike provides valuable insights into this important issue and highlights the need for continued efforts to promote safe cycling in our community. We hope that this data-driven approach will inspire further dialogue and action, and ultimately contribute to a safer and more sustainable future for our city.

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our lives, and one area that has seen some surprising changes is traffic accidents in Madrid. By analyzing 
  a dataset of traffic accidents in the city from 2019 to 2023, we can see some fascinating trends that shed light on how the pandemic has affected road safety.</p>

<p>Let's start with the basics. From our analysis, we have a calendar plot of traffic accidents in Madrid over the past few years. The plot shows a clear drop in 
  accidents during the strict lockdown measures of 2020, as people stayed home, and roads emptied out. However, as restrictions eased in 2021 and 2022, accidents 
  began to climb again, despite ongoing social distancing measures. This suggests that there is more to road safety than simply reducing the number of cars on the road.</p>

<p>Digging deeper, we can also see some interesting patterns in the data when we look at accidents over the week and over the day. For example, weekends are a clear 
  danger zone - accidents are much more likely to occur on Saturdays and Sundays than on weekdays, however during covid times, the peak in the number of accidents 
  is experimented on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays.</p>

<p>Similarly, there is a clear peak in accidents around midday, suggesting that factors such as lunchtime traffic and rush hour congestion are key contributors 
  to road accidents. However, it can be clearly seen that during covid time accidents that usually occurred during those times are spaced in time, ranging between 
  13:00 and 19:00.<p>

<p>Moving on to geography, we have a street-view heatmap of traffic accidents in Madrid. This map provides a visual representation of where accidents tend to 
  occur, with hotspots shown in red and cooler areas shown in blue. Unsurprisingly, the busiest central districts of the city, such as Madrid Centro and 
  Moncloa-Aravaca, are hotspots for accidents. These areas are characterized by high levels of traffic, with many commuters, tourists, students and residents 
  navigating busy streets and intersections.</p>

<p>But there are also some surprising outliers on the map. For example, the southern district of Puente de Vallecas stands out as a hotspot for accidents, despite 
  being relatively quiet compared to other central districts. This could be due to factors such as road layout and infrastructure, or it could be linked to 
  socio-economic factors such as poverty and lack of access to safe transportation.</p>

<p>Finally, we have a plot of the sex and age of victims of traffic accidents in Madrid during the pandemic. This data shows that men are much more likely to be 
  involved in accidents than women, and that men aged 35-39 are at the highest risk. This is a pattern that holds true across all districts of the city, 
  and suggests that targeted road safety campaigns aimed at young men could be a key way to reduce accidents in the future.</p>

<p>Overall, our analysis of traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023 highlights the complex interplay between factors such as road infrastructure, 
  traffic volume, and human behaviour. By continuing to monitor and analyze these trends, we can work towards a safer and more sustainable future for our city's roads.</p>

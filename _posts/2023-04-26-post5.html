<p>Picture this: it's a beautiful, sunny day in Madrid, and you're cruising down the road, feeling the wind in your hair. But suddenly, you hear a screeching sound, and before you know it, 
  you've been in an accident. Surprisingly, this scenario is more common than you might think.</p>

<p>Our research into traffic accidents in Madrid from 2019 to 2023 revealed that most accidents occur on clear, sunny days. This may come as a surprise to many, as adverse weather conditions 
  such as rain, snow, and fog are often seen as the main culprits for traffic accidents. However, the reality is that most days in Madrid are clear and sunny, making it the most common weather
  condition on the days of accidents.</p>

<p>To dive deeper into the impact of weather on traffic accidents, we created two visualizations. The first is a Bokeh plot that shows the number of accidents per day and per year in Madrid 
  by weather conditions. As expected, we noticed an increase in accidents on days with adverse weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and fog. However, what stood out to us was the high number
  of accidents on clear days.</p>
